## Machinelearning
In this analysis different machine learning algorithm is applied on three different datasets to identify the patterns/insights.
1. Suicide Rate Prediction: Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting regression is used to predict and validated using k-fold validation 
2. Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Na√Øve Bayes algorithm is applied to predict the booking cancellation based on booking information.
3. Bittering units of Beer Prediction: K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and gradient boosting algorithm is applied on  dataset to predict the bitterness of beer based on the brewing style.
