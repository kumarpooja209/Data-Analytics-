## Machinelearning
In this analysis different machine learning algorithm is applied on three different datasets to identify the patterns/insights.
1. Suicide Rate Prediction: Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting regression is used to predict and validated using k-fold validation 
2. Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Na√Øve Bayes algorithm is applied to predict the booking cancellation based on booking information.
3. Bittering units of Beer Prediction: K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and gradient boosting algorithm is applied on  dataset to predict the bitterness of beer based on the brewing style.

4a. Audio classification based on emotions: For this classification four datasets are combined and data augmentation has performed. This experiment was without augmentation and only MFCC feature was extracted.

4b. In this experiment data was augmented and MFCC, Mel spectrogram, chroma vector and zero-crossing rate features were extracted.
